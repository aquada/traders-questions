### Write a little about yourself eg. where you were born, bit about your past live, where you live now, interests when away from the charts, if you have a job outside of trading, something not many people know about you.
> I was born (1967) in a small village in Essex called Hullbridge. I found myself pursuing adventures, travelled round the world, came back and worked for Microsoft, got my instructors for diving, then advance motorcycle, my Privates Pilots and then travelled and travelled some more and finally realised that I wasn't really going anywhere. On these travels I metand fell in love with a South African in India then moved to South Africa in 2009. I love the  beach life, geeking around with computers and Linux, rural rather than urban now.
