&lt;p>I was born (1967) in a small village in Essex called Hullbridge. I found myself pursuing adventures, travelled round the world, came back and worked for Microsoft, got my instructors for diving, then advance motorcycle, my Privates Pilots and then travelled and travelled some more and finally realised that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really going anywhere. On these travels I metand fell in love with a South African in India then moved to South Africa in 2009. I love the beach life, geeking around with computers and Linux, rural rather than urban now.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item></channel></rss>
